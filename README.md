# DoubleDoppel
Inspired by the impressive casting in the show 'Dark', where different versions of the same character span multiple timelines, DoubleDoppel is a client side machine learning application that searches through ~8000 actors on backstage.com and uses facial recognition to quickly find a list of actors that share similar facial features with a face in an uploaded picture. An application like this could be used in casting calls to find new stars!
