# DoubleDoppel
Inspired by the impressive casting in the show 'Dark', 
where different versions of the same character span multiple timelines, 
DoubleDoppel is a demo machine learning application that uses facial recognition to compare a face in a reference image with
~8000+ profiles on <a href="https://www.backstage.com/" target="_blank">backstage.com</a>
and returns a list of actors/actresses with similar features.
